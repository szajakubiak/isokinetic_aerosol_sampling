# Isokinetic aerosol sampling
Calculate probe diameter to sample aerosol particles isokinetically.

## Detailed description
When sampling an aerosol from the gas stream to the particle counter, it is important that the linear velocity of the aerosol in the sampler should be equal to the velocity in the duct. Otherwise the determined particle size distribution won't be representative for the sampled aerosol, e.g. there will be an overrepresentation of large particles if the linear velocity in the sampler is lower than in the duct (this mechanism is described [here](https://backend.orbit.dtu.dk/ws/portalfiles/portal/5547945/Fauser.PDF)). It is therefore important to use probe tips with a diameter as close as possible to that determined by this script. 

## Dependencies
The Python 3 and guizero package are required to run this script.
